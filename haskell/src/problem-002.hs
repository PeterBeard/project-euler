-- Problem #2
--
-- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
-- two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
-- 
-- 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
-- 
-- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
-- four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

fibs = 1 : 2 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

solution = sum $ filter (\x -> mod x 2 == 0) $ takeWhile(< 4000000) fibs

main = putStrLn $ "The sum of the even Fibonacci numbers < 4,000,000 is " ++ (show solution)
